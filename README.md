# The Way Bot
An automated machine archivist, collecting human expressions of emotion.

## History
The Way Bot began as a read-only twitter script that simply recorded phrases matching a specific form (the first was "The way that ...."). The results of this script were compiled into a book for [Darius's 2013 NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/53). This previous work is available at [elib/NovelHarvesterBot](https://github.com/elib/NovelHarvesterBot).

## tl;dr how do I run it

You'll need Ruby and a few gems:
- Twitter
- StandaloneMigrations
- ActiveRecord
- Nokogiri
- Neocitizen

The Way Bot also requires [Wordfilter by DariusK](https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter).
